# GrOne Visualizer

This visualizer illustrates the dependencies of a Java project.

Only public Github repositories are accepted as input, and the url inputted must be structured like this:

```https://github.com/[owner]/[repository]```

```npm install``` should be run first.
```npm start``` is used to initialize the server.

# Deployment
As the program is locally deployed, each physical component should start their respective components.
