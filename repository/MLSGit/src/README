------------------------------
NOTE ABOUT UNFINISHED PROGRAM:
This is the prototype GUI for the library system.
Made with code that Team 9 members have created.

Some GUI related code was taken from the internet, and modified, for example the code related to searching books/customers, 
which is not the same code we use for searching in the other library system (the console system).

The project is unfinished and the code has not had any clean up done, and has not been made modularized yet. 
There was no time to finish it and modularize it, therefore the code is very messy and might be hard to read.

There was not time to implement some of the functions that exist in the console-run library system, such as removing books, etc.

Many other functions are working though, but there are still a lot of bugs.
There was not enough time to fix all the bugs, so please be ware that they exist in the program.

Overall the program runs fine in its unfinished state.
